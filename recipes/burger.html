    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Onions and beef go together like baths and bubbles, like Wallace and Gromit, like hitchhikers and towels, like...you get the picture. They belong together, long for each other's company. A burger without onions is still a burger, but tuck a few slices of raw sweet onion underneath or spread a pile of deeply browned caramelized onions on top and you've got yourself something that is suddenly more than the sum of its parts.

        Nowhere is this fact more well-known than in Oklahoma, home of the Onion Burger, a burger that is nearly as much onion as it is meat. We're gonna talk about how to make your own at home.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon canola oil</li>
            <li>5 ounces freshly ground beef, divided into two 2 1/2-ounce balls</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced (about 1 cup sliced onions)</li>
            <li>2 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>2 soft hamburger buns</li>
            <li><em>Mustard, pickles, and other condiments, if desired</em></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread canola oil inside a large cast iron skillet with a paper towel. Heat over high heat until lightly smoking. Add balls of beef and press down with the back side of a spatula until completely flattened. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, spread onions evenly over cooking burgers and press down to embed onions into meat. Let cook with no further pressing until burgers are well browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully flip burgers with a stiff spatula, making sure to pick up all browned meat from skillet. Let cook until onions start to soften, about 1 minute. Add cheese and top with top bun. Place bottom bun upside-down over top bun to allow it to steam in the onion vapors.</li>
            <li>When buns are soft, transfer bottom buns to a plate. Add condiments if desired. Lift up onions, burger, and top bun together and transfer to bottom bun. Repeat with second burger. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
